# Breast Cancer Detection

This project is a machine learning model designed to predict whether a patient has breast cancer or not based on 30 features from the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset**. It uses supervised learning techniques to classify the data into two classes: **Malignant** (cancerous) or **Benign** (non-cancerous).

## Overview
Breast cancer is one of the most common forms of cancer worldwide, and early detection is crucial for effective treatment. This project aims to help in diagnosing breast cancer by predicting its presence based on features derived from a patient's tumor data.

The model is trained using 30 different features, such as **radius mean**, **texture mean**, and others. These features are inputs, and the model predicts whether the cancer is **malignant** or **benign**.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the **Breast Cancer Wisconsin (Diagnostic) Dataset** available from the UCI Machine Learning Repository.

- **Number of Instances:** 569
- **Number of Features:** 30
- **Classes:** Malignant (1) and Benign (0)
- **Source:** [UCI Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Breast+Cancer+Wisconsin+%28Diagnostic%29)

## Installation
To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/Valjiman/breast-cancer-detection.git
   ```

2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd breast-cancer-detection
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## How to Use

### Step 1: Running the Flask Web Application
To launch the web application where you can input the 30 features manually:

```bash
python app.py
```

### Step 2: Enter the Features
- After launching the Flask app, go to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` in your browser.
- You will be prompted to input 30 features related to the tumor's properties.
- The app will predict whether the tumor is **Malignant** or **Benign** based on your input.

### Step 3: Predictions
Once the model processes the input, it will display a result indicating whether the patient is likely to have cancer (**Malignant**) or not (**Benign**).

## Model and Prediction
The machine learning model used in this project is a **XGBoost**. The model was trained on the breast cancer dataset with 80% of the data used for training and 20% used for testing.

You can find the model training process in the Jupyter notebook `notebook.ipynb`.

## Results
The model's performance is evaluated using metrics like **accuracy**, **precision**, **recall**, and **F1-score**. It achieved the following results:

- **Accuracy:** 98.5%
- **Precision:** 98.7%
- **Recall:** 98.3%
